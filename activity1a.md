# Activity 1a: Identify your goals

## Why are you taking this course?
I haven't written a lot of documentation, and I think a structured course will help increase my confidence before I start contributing to projects or apply for jobs. Showing my work to strangers feels uncomfortable right now. Sharing these activities publically is a happy medium between writing for real projects and only writing for myself.

## What are your career ambitions related to API documentation?
I'm underemployed. I work as a SR&ED tech writer and hate it, feel trapped by it. Initially, I wasn't sure what to do with myself, but eventually I realized I was a tech writer, just one that isn't doing the right type of work. I'm a developer, I'm comfortable with programming and APIs. So why not leverage that?

My goals are to find a job, and start working on something I can take pride in. While I would love to find a position in the game industry, that is unlikely. But my interests are broad and getting involved in any part of the tech industry excites me.

## Are you in a place where developer documentation jobs are plentiful?
Fredericton has a moderate-sized tech sector. IBM, Salesforce, Skillshare, and Unisys have offices here, but I've seen very few technical writing positions and no developer documentation positions. Other parts of Canada are much more promising. I'm expect to move, and I am okay with that.

## What would you consider to be a success metric for this course?
It is all about feelings. I'll be happy if feel prepared to write documentation for GitHub projects without wondering whether I'm doing it all wrong.

## Do you have the technical mindset needed to excel in developer documentation fields?
I have a dual BCS/BSc (Physics), worked on the D0 and ATLAS particle physics experiments, and enjoy programming. Perhaps most importantly, I am have a need to learn new things.
