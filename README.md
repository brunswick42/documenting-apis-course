# Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers

This repository stores my solutions for the activities in Tom Johnson's course, [Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_introtoapis.html). I've excluded activities which lack original work (e.g. [Activity: Get familiar with the OpenWeatherMap API](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_scenario_for_using_weather_api.html#-activity-get-familiar-with-the-openweathermap-api)) as they just ask the reader to follow a few steps to gain insight into a technology.

## List of completed activities
- [Activity 1a: Identify your goals](activity1a.md)
- [Resource description for the Surfreport endpoint](surfreport-resource.md)
- [Endpoint for surfreport API](surfreport-endpoints.md)
