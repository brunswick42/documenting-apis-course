# Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers

This repository stores my solutions for the activities in Tom Johnson's course, [Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers
](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_introtoapis.html). Any activity that lacks original work, where the reader simply follows a few steps to gain insight into a technology, is excluded.
